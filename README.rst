Alas, there is no epub version of the Jungle World, http://jungle-world.com .

Hence this little module to download the current issue and pack it into one
HTML file which can then be converted to epub (using e.g. http://calibre-ebook.com).
It also downloads the cover image for easy inclusion when creating the book
in calibre.



Dependencies
============

$ apt-get install python-beautifulsoup

OR

$ pip install BeautifulSoup



Usage
=====

Copy settings.py.example to settings.py and edit it to match your login /
password (or leave it empty, most articles are available freely anyway).

Import the class wherever you want or run it like this:

$ python jw2html/__init__.py


It will create a cache dir of downloaded stories as sepcified in settings.py
and create a cover image and an HTML file to feed to your favourite epub
converter in your current directory.
